# Frontend Assignment

Your assignment is to make an app that displays 3-week treatment program. Treatment program used as input is described in JSON file and the desired output is presented in a design.

## Input Format

Example input for the 3-week treatment program is located in [examples/program.json](examples/program.json). The input has the following format:

```json
{
  "week<number>": [{
    "weekday": "MONDAY" || "TUESDAY" || "WEDNESDAY" || "THURSDAY" || "FRIDAY" || "SATURDAY" || "SUNDAY",
    "title": "Title for the daily activity",
    "completed": true || false
  }, ...]
}
```

Input contains three weeks. Each week contains multiple activities. Each activity has three fields: `weekday` indicates the day of week for the activity, `title` is a short description of the daily activity and `completed` indicates whether the user has done the activity.

## Output Design

![](examples/design.png)

Treatment program is visualised on a calendar. The calendar is always displaying current ongoing month and displays today as active with a different background color (14th in the picture above).

The treatment program starts on the first full week of the month and continues for three weeks. The activity of the day is displayed under the day number. The day number will have different color depending on whether it has an activity or not.

If a user has not completed an activity in the past, the activity will be moved to the current day. There can be only one activity per day. Thus if there are multiple incomplete activities in the past, the first incomplete activity will be displayed today, the second tomorrow, and so forth. For the previous days only completed activities will be displayed.

Your app should match the design in the picture above using the following specs:

### Colors

* Black: `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8)`
* Green: `rgb(93, 175, 116)`
* White: `rgb(255, 255, 255)`

### Text Styles

* `h1` [Fjalla One 700](https://fonts.google.com/?query=Fjalla+One) `48px / 1.3`
* `h2` [Libre Franklin 700](https://fonts.google.com/?query=Libre+Franklin) `64px`
* `h3` [Libre Franklin 400](https://fonts.google.com/?query=Libre+Franklin) `10px / 1.2`
* `th` [Work Sans 700](https://fonts.google.com/?query=Work+Sans) `16px`

## Tech

## Delivering

Make a pull request of your assignment and leave it open when you are done :slightly_smiling_face:

You should at least update the `README.md` with installation and running instructions. Also consider how you demonstrate that your app is working as intended.

**Remember to check that you have committed all required files and instructions before submitting the pull request** :white_check_mark: Good way to check this is to clone the repository into different folder and follow the instructions you have written to run the app.
